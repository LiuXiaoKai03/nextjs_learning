// 1. loading.tsx is a special Next.js file built on top of Suspense, it allows you to create fallback UI to show as a replacement while page content loads.
// 2. Since <SideNav> is static, it's shown immediately. The user can interact with <SideNav> while the dynamic content is loading.
// 3.The user doesn't have to wait for the page to finish loading before navigating away (this is called interruptable navigation).
